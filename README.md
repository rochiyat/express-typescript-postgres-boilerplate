# Boilerplate for Next.js, Express, and PostgreSQL Integration

This repository provides a boilerplate for building a full-stack web application using Next.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend API, and PostgreSQL as the database. It is designed to streamline the development process by offering a pre-configured setup that integrates these technologies seamlessly.

## Features
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized for performance.
- **Express.js**: RESTful API setup with routing and middleware support.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database integration with Sequelize or Prisma for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **Environment Configuration**: Ready-to-use `.env` for environment variables.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Pre-configured for code linting and formatting.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Configure your database and environment variables in the `.env` file.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

This boilerplate serves as a foundation for your Next.js projects that require a robust backend API and a scalable database solution.
